Follow along with the demo to learn how to calculate percentage change using R and the Tidyverse. You should get started by loading the tidyverse in a new R block.


### Task 1: Load the tidyverse


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```




### Task 2: Load the UMD Fees dataset from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/umd_fees.csv

```{r}
umd_fees <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/umd_fees.csv")
```

### Task 3: Calculate the percentage change in each category between Fall 2024 and Fall 2021 using `mutate()`

```{r}
umd_fees_pct <- umd_fees |> mutate(pct_change = (`Fall 2024`- `Fall 2021`)/`Fall 2021` * 100)
```

```{r}
umd_fees_pct_2524 <- umd_fees |> mutate(pct_change = (`Fall 2025`- `Fall 2024`)/`Fall 2024` * 100)
```

```{r}
comp <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/class_composition.csv")

comp |>
  summarize(
    mean_first = mean(first_year),
    mean_soph = mean(sophomore),
    mean_junior = mean(junior),
    mean_senior = mean(senior),
    mean_grad = mean(grad)
  )
```



### Task 4: Describe our results

Write a few sentences about what you found in the data. What's the story here?


The University of Maryland's student fees have increased 4.5% between 2025 and 2024, with the largest increase coming to shuttle bus fees. These fees increased by $30, from 311 to 341, for a 9.6% change. The largest percent change came to student activities fees, which increased 14.6% from $89 to $102. No changes were made to fees for student sustainability or athletics. 


When you are done, save your work, switch to GitHub Desktop, then add, commit and push your changes to GitHub and submit the URL of the notebook in ELMS.
