title: "Sampling"
---

Follow along with the demo to learn how to sample data from a population using R and the Tidyverse. You should get started by loading the tidyverse in a new R block.

### Task 1: Load the tidyverse
```{r}
library('tidyverse')
```

### Task 2: Load 1,000 rows of data with the ages of people from 18-80
```{r}
set.seed(42)

population <- tibble(
  age = sample(18:80, 1000, replace = TRUE)

)

population
```

### Task 3: Sample 100 rows of data from the dataset

```{r}
sampled_data <- population |> 
  slice_sample(n = 30)

sampled_data
```
### Task 4: Calculate the mean age and standard deviation of the sample

```{r}
sample_stats <- sampled_data |>
  summarise(
    mean_age = mean(age),
    sd_age = sd(age)
  )

sample_stats
```
### Task 5: Calculate the mean age and standard deviation of the population
```{r}
population_stats <- population |>
  summarise(
    mean_age = mean(age),
    sd_age = sd(age)
  )

population_stats
```
### Task 6: Compare the sample and population statistics

Compare the means and standard deviations. Are they similar? Go back and re-run the sampling and statistics calculations with a smaller sample size. How do the results change?

The mean age for the population was 49.873, while the mean age for the sample was 48.77. The standard deviation of the population was 17.50627, while the standard deviation of the sample was 18.90532. The standard deviation is a little notably bigger than the population, but nothing crazy. The mean age was pretty similar, just a 1 year difference basically. 

When I made the sample size 30, the mean age became 48.96667 and the standard deviation became 19.05977, which is even greater a distance than the standard deviation of the population, but is to be expected when you make the sample size smaller. The mean actually got closer to the mean age of the population. 

When finished, save your work, switch to GitHub Desktop, then add, commit and push your changes to GitHub and submit the URL of the notebook in ELMS.
